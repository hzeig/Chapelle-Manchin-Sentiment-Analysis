The framers of the U.S. Constitution saw this SHIT coming:ﾠ


*no amendments of the proper kind would ever be obtained by the people, if the [federal] Government should become oppressive""* - George Mason, 1787


So they wrote in [Article 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Procedures_for_amending_the_Constitution) as the last ditch emergency method to propose a constitutional amendment (the highest authority) via the state legislators [limited convention](https://archive.ph/Cv2zU), bypassing Congress and going above the Supreme Court - so long as it has widespread popular support and the people take action.


Stopping the influence of big money in Congress has [over 80%](https://archive.md/eCMBy) of the public's support while the specific policies included in the For The People Act (H. R. 1) have [bipartisan popular support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act#Public_opinion). Zero Republican senators are in favor of H. R. 1



Many state legislators are not thrilled about Congress and corruption either! Unlike all their counterparts in federal Congress, state legislators are usually approachable and more receptive to their voter base. While some do dream of going to federal Congress, many can't be bothered with all the [gaslighting](https://youtu.be/DyXspSJITpY?t=253s), [telemarketing](https://archive.ph/MKNeo) and corruption.ﾠ


And if they don't want to end corruption (or care more about their special interest donors if they have any), their minds WILL change if you can get enough of their constituent voters to give them a call.


The bottleneck: not enough people know the [problem](https://wolf-pac.com/the_problem/) or the [solution](https://wolf-pac.com/the_solution/), and not enough people are willing to do any work - not even an easy hour a week.ﾠ

Voting is the bare minimum of democratic participation. Never stop voting, but consider that even without deep pockets you can do so much more.


Change at the local level is how you [SEND](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-pace-of-social-change/) ideas to federal Congress and [prod them](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Congressional+Research+Service%22+%22prodding+effect%E2%80%9D) to make changes.

I think nobody has any idea how to improve the system, if they know about the problem at all. Too many people have suspicions but not sources. We can fix that.

I think we all might just be too spoiled these days. Everything is at our fingertips.

We can't expect to be gratified and incentivized for every little thing we do that is good for ourselves or the world. Sometimes it's self-discipline that will get you through since motivation is unreliable.

We have to make a choice. Do we want to run and hide from the biggest, most critical, most at the root problem we face?

Doing so feels pretty bad. That might be good enough for a lot of people to take action.

[Amendments](https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendments.html) 1, 5, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 24 and 26 were all big (some much bigger than others) steps forward for democracy and gave power to the people. [Amendment 27](https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment27.html) was about closing a financial conflict of interest loophole in federal Congress and it was a 19 year old college student who [got the ball rolling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)

It's been a little while since we've had any big deal amendments like those that I mentioned prior to the 27th. 
Before each amendment was made they always felt impossibly out of reach - but they were not!

Combined with a compromised court system that often shields corrupt politicians, even if a politician appears pretty damn guilty - if they aren't being prosecuted and convicted then media are not going to touch it.

When the media do touch it, they have to lay out the facts and let the public read between the lines and come to the right conclusion. E.g. ""He accepted this ..... and then this happened"".  


Then what usually happens is the politician says ""I don't remember what happened"", no investigation is brought forth and its swept under the rug.

"&gt;Mainstream media will likely never discuss political corruption.

This is 100% the problem, but I'll admit I've been shocked from this round of budget talks because it's actually been discussed, even on CNN Cuomo had a segment on lobbyists/corruption! I have NEVER seen that before. 

This is an extremely difficult problem to solve. I think the ultimate strategy will be similar to AOC, - having a huge media profile and using that to get inside the system and break the mainstream corporate narratives. 

A progressive trolling operation, where generating media coverage through controversy is the best way to expose your underlying *real* message. Before AOC progressives were basically banned from mainstream media, and you could see the media blackout around Bernie Sanders. Now it's quite common to have the Katie Porters, Ilhan Omar's etc, participating in news room discussions. 

The one thing in our favor is that cable news is slowly dying, and the most valuable demographics to advertisers are younger people, who skew massively progressive. That means that corporate pushback can afford to be a little gentler because people like AOC drive huge ratings. 

It's shit that it has to come down to this, but dealing with a fundamentally broken and corrupt media is almost impossible. Things are slowly getting better!!!

This is why I think people underestimate the power of AOC - it's not just about the bills you pass(not many obviously!), it's how you influence the national discussion.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.85, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.6895, -2.967525, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.5895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.6605, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, -3.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.715,0.122,0.773,0.105,2

I think nobody has any idea how to improve the system, if they know about the problem at all. Too many people have suspicions but not sources. We can put people in the know with a little time and effort

I think we all might just be too spoiled these days. Everything is at our fingertips, consuming clickbait after clickbait.

We can't expect to be gratified and incentivized for every little thing we do that is good for ourselves or the world. Sometimes it's self-discipline that will get you through since motivation is unreliable.

We have to make a choice. Do we want to run and hide from the biggest, most critical, most at the root problem we face?

Doing so feels pretty bad. That might be good enough for a lot of people to take action.

"People keep asking what is in the bill and who would it help.  Below is a description of all the main aspects of the bill. 

# Provisions of the 3.5 Trillion Dollar Bill

**Two free years of community college**

The legislation provides two years of free community college for all students, regardless of family income. It is anticipated to cost $108 billion.

**Child care and universal pre-K**

Every family that applies shall be offered child care assistance for children ages 0 to 5. In all, the plan allocates roughly $450 billion to lower the cost of child care and provide two years of universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, according to the House Education and Labor Committee.

**Medicare expansion**

This heavily debated provision would expand Medicare to include coverage of dental, hearing, and vision services.

**Extended child tax credit**

Democrats expanded the child tax credit for 2021 in their $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, and now want to extend it through 2025. Under the enhancement, families receive $3,600 per child under age 6, and $3,000 per child age 6 to 18. Most families receive monthly payments of either $250 or $300 per child.

**Cut prescription drug prices**

Another key provision in the bill is aimed at helping to slash prescription drug prices. Americans on average pay two to three times as much as people in other countries for prescription drugs, according to the White House. Among other things, the legislation allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Medicare is currently prohibited by law from negotiating for the best deal.

**Paid family and medical leave**

For the first time in history, the U.S. would have comprehensive paid leave, covering 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. The legislation would replace at least two-thirds of earnings, up to $4,000 per month, while the lowest-paid workers would receive 80% of their income. The White House has previously estimated the plan would cost $225 billion over the next 10 years.

**Climate change**

Combating climate change and slowing the rate at which Earth warms will mean transitioning away from fossil fuels, the major source of greenhouse gas emissions. One provision that Manchin has objected to is the  $150 billion ""clean electricity performance program,"" which would pay utility companies that increase their renewable energy supplies by 4% per year. Companies that do not hit this benchmark would face financial penalties. The bill also provides significant funding for forest management and other wildfire control measures. There are also measures to incentivize the buying of electric vehicles and the construction of charging stations; consumer rebates to homeowners who weatherfit their houses; and financial penalties for oil and gas producers for methane leaks, among other things.

**Lesser-known provisions** 

The massive bill has a slew of lesser-known provisions as well.

For instance, the bill would authorize $5 million a year for the Small Business Administration for an entrepreneurial program for formerly incarcerated individuals.

The bill also directs $2.5 billion for the Justice Department to award competitive grants or contracts to local governments, community-based organizations and other groups to support intervention strategies to reduce community violence.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, -1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.4, 0, 0, 0, 1.3, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.4, 0, 0, 2.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.1}",0.994,0.122,0.848,0.03,0

https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/nv9prz/comment/h137pir/

For the lazy:

&gt;	I live in Manchin's home town, Farmington, WV. One day, my kids were playing on the ball field in the center of town. A couple of State Troopers came roaring up in their cruisers and ordered everyone on the ball field to leave; about 20 people. 10% of the town's population. Anyway, here comes West Virginia One, a Bell helicopter. It plops down on the ballfield, and out pops Governor Manchin and his wife Gayle. His mom's house is less than a quarter mile from the ballfield, but a limousine arrived from Charleston (could tell by the plates) to pick them up and take them to Mom's for a visit. They stayed for several hours. Meanwhile, a Little League game had to be cancelled because the helicopter was still sitting there with troopers guarding it by game time. There was a large, clear field just up from Mrs. Manchin's house at the time, but I was told he wouldn't land there because it would disturb his mom. He is an unmitigated, class A, iron-clad jerk, and an embarrassment to his father's memory.

&gt;	His dad was a famous WV politician. Crooked as hell, but bigger than life. He was at every Boy Scout spaghetti dinner and union member's funeral, he'd bend over backwards to help those who needed a hand, he financially and emotionally supported the families of the miners lost in Farmington No. 9 when it blew up and he fought to get them compensated.

"I havent seen anything about retirement accounts that didnt look like improving their adoption. 

&gt; Wealthy individuals with retirement accounts exceeding $10 million would be prohibited from contributing extra savings and would have a new required minimum distribution each year, according to an outline of tax legislation unveiled Monday by the House Ways and Means Committee.

&gt; The bill would also repeal so-called Roth conversions in individual retirement accounts and 401(k)-type plans for those making more than $400,000 a year. It would also prevent savers from using the ""mega-backdoor Roth"" strategy, regardless of income level.

&gt; Further, the legislation would prohibit individual retirement accounts from holding investments that require buyers to be accredited investors, a status generally reserved for wealthy investors.

&gt; The proposals are part of a broader theme of raising taxes on those who earn more than $400,000 a year to help pay for education, climate, paid-leave, child-care and other measures while also making the tax code more equitable.

&gt; &

&gt; However, the legislation would prohibit individuals from making more contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA if the total value of their combined IRA and defined-contribution plan exceeds $10 million. A defined-contribution plan is a 401(k) plan or other similar workplace savings plan.

&gt; The policy's purpose would be ""to avoid subsidizing retirement savings once account balances reach very high levels,"" according to a proposal outline.

&gt; That limit would apply to single taxpayers with more than $400,000 of taxable income. The threshold would be $450,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $425,000 for heads of household.

How much air pollution will survivors make as they burn wood, trash &amp; cow pies after the world economy crashes hard enough that you can not buy electric power?  When all power plants are off, your $ has little value.  Chasing, catching, killing &amp; eating might quickly become more importtant than air conditioning

The mines &amp; power plants I knew of and worked in are all closed &amp; the equipment sold on scrap market.  The coal trains past my land are gone.  Most of our electric power is from methane gas.

Oh, you have a Honda engine generator.  Grin now while you can.  Assuming it has over a 10 year life while running every hour, you figure the cost of gasoline to feed it 30 days.  I have a generac gas-electric that burns $3.5/hour or $2562 monthly to run 1 RV roof AC.

My Onan generator diesel engine has 10K hour life expectancy.  0.17 gallons/hour diesel costs &gt;$370/month to idle.  0.96 gallons/hour @ full load or &gt;$2108/month. Add the costs of finding good diesel fuel, oils, parts, noise &amp; air pollution.

If solar panels were not reduced to 15% power by overcast, we could afford to generate our power here but we could not afford enough battery to have 24 hour power.

I read the Dems in IL are trying to keep coal fired &amp; nuclear plants running, because they realized batteries &amp; gas fired plants will not keep heaters running in freezing weather.

**Here are some facts**

60% of business taxes are from companies that use coal to generate electricity. 

It provides 30,000 jobs. 

~~99%~~ 89% - 99% of West Virginias electricity comes from coal. This is just the states electricity generation, this number does not represent the entire nation.

The people that live in West Virginia dont want coal to go away either. Coal is their whole lives and, for many of them, their family history.

Manchin is representing the views of his constituents which is what he is supposed to do. There are elections in NC, PA and WI this next cycle with actual opportunities. Flipping Manchin's seat to a more liberal vote would be like flipping Utah it just isn't going to happen.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.993, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.8, 0, 0, 0, -1.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.872,0.094,0.889,0.016,0

I suspect that's why he leaked his plan to leave the Democratic party and become an independent.  The provisions in the reconciliation bill are overwhelmingly popular, extending the eligible age and expanding coverage for Medicare, child tax credit, free public college education, etc.

Manchin might be realizing that his plan to run for WV Governor in 2024 might not pan out at this point, because of the animosity that WV Democrats feel for him right now.  If he plans to run for re-election for his Senate seat as a Democrat, he could very well get primaried next year.  He stands no chance running as a Republican, because there will be a ""real"" Republican that will get the nomination.  Running as an Independent is his best chance to get re-elected if he can retain some of his Democratic voters and he is able to draw off enough Republican voters.

Manchin is merely the face you're being given to hate while the puppeteers sit back and divert attention from themselves to their pawns.

Well, this is not for the federal government to decide.  In fact, it would be rather unconstitutional for the federal government to interfere and provide investment capabilities in a specific state.  This is the job of the state itself.  When one does not have a well-trained and educated labor pool, when one does not have access to major metropolitan centers with science and culture, it is remarkably difficult to attract modern industries.  

On the other hand, there would be a role for coal, even if we move far more decisively into non-carbon energy generation.

Not at all.  I am just telling it as it is.  We are generating a huge number of products and carbon is the key element for hundreds of them.

Are you serious? Progressives mean nothing really?  They are the only reason Dems won anything in 2020. And the Lincoln Project which was all Republicans. So thank you to all our Blue rebels for throwing out the tyrant, it's a shame more aren't appreciative.  Neither will be helping DNC win their seats next week, they are fighting for the future of state legislatures, gerrymandering, electoral maps. 

The DNC is a dead seriously flawed and deceptive machine that lost us our Democracy. The Hillary election debacle against a clear facist authoritative compromised felon was proof ~ GOP established a facist regime eliminated the House of Representatives, ALL Executive and Judicial Branch oversight, put Foreign Agents in the highest positions of power, ignored the Constition, Supreme Court, Rule of Law, Eliminated Corporate Taxation and created 4 National Emergencies 'Wars' on every border and killed 1 million Americans between Oxycontin &amp; Covid hoaxing and ended with public overthrow of Soveriegn States Certified Elections, and 27 Supreme Court cases to establish Texas rules us all, all States aren't to be treated equally. Only Red States get ventilatorsvand get to Vote by Mail remember. And not one person has been held accountable that wasn't pardoned to participate in yet another insurrection on Jan 6th. If anything is proven, running for US President makes you and your foreign army immune from all international law and Democratic Constitution in perpetuity. In fact Law doesn't exist! So much Freedom! Vote for a Facist! 

Democracy over, DNC still backs the W.R.O.N.G. candidate in primaries in so MANY Presidential House &amp; Senate races compketely ignoring State Legislatures to maximize DNC Party Power and control. DNC gambling on which states even get ad cash or a drive-by visit by Hillary or Biden are more hypocritical choices showing how weak DNC long term strategy is, centralizing Party power rather than sharing it adequately between Progressives &amp; DNC &amp; Independents and Regionally. Nancy Pelosi promised to give House Leadership role to Progressives if she were given her last term, nope. DNC plays all it's cards on old heroes of lost wars for name recognition in a system that makes all the Corporate owners happy, demonizing any other option within their own party as Bernie Socialism. DNC, it's worst enemy, always splits it's own party sure workers will come through. Now it's a much different game with far different stakes requiring radical solution. 

DNC knows Sinema Manchin were NEVER blue and NEVER voted for basic blue policies, but pretend to  'negotiate' while grandstanding for their REAL Corporate Puppeteers and local money, actually doing more damage to ANY chance of Blue legislation least of all Voting Rights. Let the Republican win and take blame for hideous results, instead WVA VA AZ MI PA WI swing states will 'flip' back to GOP with new voting restrictions, embedded GQP state legislatures and plans to repopulate Mars since Corporations have mined this planet and humans to death. DNC won't mind,  they're Corporate puppets too. 'Govt By The People, For the People' experiment failed and everybody shrugs, no other option.

It's time for radical change in the way the Blue Party and our fake Democracy is run. It won't happen without Voting Rights. GOP took and is taking ours. So facism is here to stay along with the imminent GOP Revolution and Civil War - they only buy more guns and ammo, even in a pandemic and its not to fight the Russians, its to go to *actual* war with Blue, Races, Religions and toilet paper. 

The way forward is lots easier when you admit what's really happened when someone is told you 'this is your only option' 'you don't have the margins' 'it's only West Virginia'. If we all don't get a Vote anymore nothing else is possible. We are cattle, China, Russia. Manchin Sinema won't ensure their own constituents can Vote. =ﾩ=ﾩ BIG red flag =ﾩ=ﾩThey Voted against HR1.

Pretty sure you've just proven there's very little 'team effort' between actual Blue Candidates and their Voters when DNC Progressives and Moderates refuse to be civil on discussion boards while they demonize, primary and cancel each other at the polls. I'm a lifelong Dem activist who actually values the entire Blue constituency and a new model to secure State Legislatures for this  not just the DNC Power Base headliners that clearly have no power or like Manchin Sinema Lamb refuse to protect my right to Vote. 

&gt; We wouldn't have won without moderate votes

Blue didn't win Senate (it's a 'lame duck' without clear majority and VP tie-breaker) and Blue Voters abandoned Supreme Court when they Voted in Trump for 'fun'. If by moderates you mean Independents and Republicans, yes actual Republicans voted against their own party for Biden but stuck with GOP down ticket, plotting insurrection, holding Congress VP hostage to block Election Certification and git arrested in the kidnapping and assassination of a Blue Governer. Multiple sub posts and news agencies report the next Election overthrow will be successful, because 'moderate' Republicans won't be Voting Blue again. Thank 'radical socialists' Bernie and Progressives for not pulling a 3rd/Green Party splitter that would have given us a Trump dynasty lifetime appointment. 

The RNC and DNC admit they are broken because they each fail to share power between their constituent Voters (Blue= Dem, Progressive Independent) (Red= QTrumper, Evangelical, Conservatives) GOP marches like the Corporate Mercenary Army they are and destroyed Co-Equal Branches of Govt, Voting Rights, Election Law, Foreign Agency in the WH, National Security and Corp Taxes in one Presidency.

"&gt;I mean I'm sure some are gleeful about it, but a lot of that talk is also just reality. 

It's not though, because reality is that elections are lost based on a combination of media narrative and get-out-the-vote efforts on the ground. Passing good legislation hardly ever gets anyone reelected, and it often creates a huge backlash due to misinformation like in 2010. 

Progressives (at least on reddit) are very policy-focused, so they mistakenly think that most voters are like them and pay attention to that stuff. They don't really, and the midterms are going to be about some kind of bullshit like Afghanistan or some scandal that crops up in August, or really, whatever the GOP puts their heads together about over the winter break and decides to pump into Fox News for 2022. And I guarantee you that it will not be ""Democrats can't pass progressive legislation!""

&gt;The democrats will do the regular old song and dance about how you need to vote democrat anyways and next time they'll for sure pass the legislation.

Well, a lot of that talk is also just reality. The reason we can't pass it is because the majority is too small. Not because the party doesn't want to, despite all the conspiracy theories with no evidence to the contrary. 

&gt;They keep being told ""something is better than nothing"", yet your something is their nothing and then are expected to vote in line yet again.

Yep, welcome to reality in a country where 48% of the electorate wants a fascist oligarchy, and 30% don't care about policy at all. Republicans don't whine and sulk like this when they don't get everything they want in one election. They always turn out, because they understand that the long game is what matters. Progressives constantly just talk about the next election cycle. No vision whatsoever. It's embarrassing, and it creates a self-defeating narrative that Republicans would never be so dumb as to engage in. 

&gt;But it's just not realistic to assume that next year will be the one exception and that they'll make it through unscathed.

Of course not, because the party in power always loses seats except in unique circumstances like 1998 and 2002. The question is whether having an openly fascist opposition in the wings plus a clearly defined media narrative of Republican obstructionism and insufficient democratic majorities will count as a unique circumstance. It objectively *is* a unique circumstance, so a lot of it comes down to whether or not people are willing to emphasize that reality, or perpetuate delusional crap like the idea that Bernie fucking Sanders, head of the Finance Committee, is complicit in tanking this bill because he wants to with Joe Manchin. 

When Republicans sense their elections are in trouble, they get active and take action. When progressives sense trouble, they start spewing Republican propaganda because they secretly love being apathetic. If you are looking at what's happening now and finding yourself feeling apathetic, then you aren't really very dedicated to the fight. This is the time to fight hardest, but progressives hate fighting hard and love watching allies lose so they can say ""told you so"" and go back to not having to take responsibility.","{0, 0, 0, 0.65, 0, 0, 1.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.217525, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.64555, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.7605, 1.832475, 0, 0, 0, -2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.887, 0, -0.333, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.664, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.442, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.665, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.11, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -4.861875, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.887, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.5, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.8541985, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, -4.05, -2.25, -0.6, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",-0.942,0.131,0.72,0.15,2

"&gt; Why not mortgage debt or credit card debt?

Mortgage debt and credit card debt are taken on by adults, often trying to live beyond their means. Student loan debt is taken on by teenagers who are trying to start their lives. 

But apart from that, it's practical. You want the economy to keep churning? Having your upcoming generations begin their adult lives by being in debt and/or underemployed is not a good way to ensure your country's long-term economic health. 

Student debt also creates a shortage of critical workers in certain areas. We desperately need more primary care physicians, but it doesn't pay as well as specialties, so debt-ridden med school graduates tend to chase specialties instead. My partner is a social worker who genuinely wants to help the disadvantaged (those with substance abuse, psych disorders, etc) but can't afford to because of her student debt. She'll likely have to become a therapist for wealthy clients who can afford to pay more so she can pay off her student debt. And the people who need her help the most won't be able to get it.

No one is holding out.  It's that we're in the middle of a crisis where an entire generation of students is indebted to the government for a required part of life, and it's stifling economic growth because they can't buy shit, buy a house, have kids, etc.

Cool story.  How long did it take you to pay off your loans?  Did you suffer financial hardship due to the required education needed for that ""high paying job""?  Why haven't you bought a house already?  Sounds like you can afford it.   I took student loans for both of my degrees, and paid off both of them within about a year of graduation, but I still whole-heartedly believe that student loan forgiveness would be a boon to the economy of this country.  And I don't feel bad that I paid mine off.

&gt;I will never understand the demand that loans you took out and are expected repay should be forgiven for no reason other than you want a $1k a month extra in your bank account.

The economy is stagnating as more and more money collects in the pockets and investments of the wealthy.  There has been very little growth of the middle class due to this stagnation.  The minimum wage hasn't changed in 30 years.  The actual wages of workers in the US have gone down over that time due to inflation.  

Think of it as a tax break on the middle class, and you'll feel better.","{0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, -1.147, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.962, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.25, 0, -0.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.775, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.4, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.378025, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85}",0.955,0.103,0.846,0.051,1

Meaningless statement backed by no real data. Democrats are still consistently beating republicans in generic ballot polls. Nobody trusts any politicians anymore because when one party undos what their party does they blame both parties for some reason, so mistrust is just standard across the board right now.

&gt;Americans gave everything Obama and the Dems needed to civilize our health system and they failed.

Healthcare reform wasn't a big part of the 2008 campaign, and no democrat running in 2008 ran on a promise of passing universal healthcare or a public option. Obamacare wasn't the best but it successfully moved the goalposts while improving a lot of people's lives. Only after Obamacare did M4A enter the mainstream discussion, specifically because of the incremental step that the ACA was.

&gt;This is a critical, dangerous moment and the Dems have a system where they wont/cannot wrangle rogue behavior?

Congress is not ""the democrat's system"" it's congress. Yes, apparently they cant wrangle rogue behavior. That's a problem. If you want to damage their ability to actually pass what you want them to pass by punishing them for not passing it yet, well here's a gun and there's your foot - have at it.

&gt;Can they not punish or bribe even if were on the cusp of the destruction of our democracy?

I think this is a good question and it will be interesting to see if we get to learn what was or wasn't offered. I certainly share your frustration and am scratching my head too as to why all these very public efforts - I would say unprecedented - aren't working.

&gt;Go watch Bernie in that Fox News town hall and tell me not enough of the rightwing would break-off if universal care were on the line.

I've seen it. You're smoking crack if you think that those people would actually vote for Sanders when they get to the voting booth, let alone endorse M4A, the least-Republican policy imaginable. Republicans have the opportunity for vote for progressive candidates just as often as you do, and they choose not to, because they don't want those policies. They'll gladly embrace them after they're passed over their opposition, and be dragged kicking and screaming into a better life, but they will always vote against doing anything that helps people other than themselves.

Under the circumstances of the Afghan army crumbling? Absolutely. Unless you're suggesting that we should have sent in more troops and postponed the pullout, which of course would have easily turned into a permanent postponement. 

&gt;we left billions of pieces of military hardware (that you and I paid for)

You don't seem like an idiot so I assume you are aware that you are repeating misinformation here. How about you don't?

The hardware we ""left"" was hardware in the hands of the afghan military who were supposed to use it to fight the Taliban. Do you think it would have been more competent leadership to leave them with less sufficient equipment to cover our retreat?

&gt;Sorry, I just have standards for my government I guess.

Indeed you do. They seem largely informed by Hollywood and Tom Clancy. I prefer to base my standards on reality.

&gt;I blamed the leadership, and you heard me curse the people on the ground?

Well you didn't give any clear critique of what the leadership did wrong, and given that the main bad thing that people are aware of is that the Taliban took over too quickly and a big suicide bomb went off, who else other than the people on the ground is there left to blame? No obviously you're not blaming them, but the reality is that most of what went wrong was unpreventable, so your attempts to assign blame anywhere don't make much sense, which is what I'm pointing out.

&gt; And why are you so determined to find zero flaws in Trump and Bidens plan?

Because I've followed that stupid fucking war for 20 years and I'm aware of what is and isn't possible. Trump's plan was absolutely flawed, and him cutting out the Afghan government from the process was a huge mistake that potentially could have prevented some of the chaos, but the best he could have done is create a situation where we pulled out less quickly and more afghans died in the defensive fighting against the Taliban who would inevitably win. It would have been worth trying, but probably wouldn't have made a big difference. Trump was an asshole for ripping the band-aid off without even trying to mitigate the pain, but the bandaid needed to be ripped regardless. 

&gt; You think there was no possible way the pullout could have been smoother?

Other than the aforementioned Trump screw-up, no. Or to put it another way, once Biden was in office and decided to fulfill the pullout rather than risk re-entrenchment, I do not see any way it could have gone smoother given what was inevitable at that point, and I think we actually pulled of something of a miracle in that regard with zero American civilian casualties, one of the most logistically impressive evacuation campaigns of all history (not exaggerating at all), and relatively few military casaulties, and no real geopolitical fallout to speak of.

"&gt;Well, they hold a functional 51-50 majority in the Senate, and they hold the presidency.

&gt;The Democrats control the Senate, you just want to disown the Democratic agenda selectively.

There are 48 Dems, that is not a functional majority, that is not overwhelming legislative power.

If the Democrats controlled the Senate then Biden wouldn't still be waiting for his appointments to be confirmed.

&gt;and they hold the presidency.

The executive branch has nothing to do with the legislature.

&gt;Does not include the Senators obstructing Congress, as the GOP alone do not have the seats to do so.

They have more seats than Dems, and they are obstructing Biden's appointments just fine, as they have obstructed functional government for decades now.

&gt;Right now, they do not hold the House. They do not hold the Senate. They do not hold the Presidency.

They have more seats than Dems in the Senate, and they are obstructing everything just fine.

They don't need to own congress to do that.

&gt;How on earth can you not put this inability to pass progressive legislation anywhere but on the Democrats? That's delusional.

Have you not watching the GOP act?

At best Dems have a tie breaker vote.

&gt;Doesn't change the fact that Democrats could steamroll Republicans if the leadership if they maintained party discipline.

Lol, and what does this ""discipline"" look like in your head?

&gt;But the leadership doesn't even try. BEcause they don't want progressive reform.

Lay out precisely what they can do to bypass GOP obstruction.

And then explain to me why you refuse to condemn the GOP.

&gt;When they hold the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, the Democratic Party, and the American people are victims of the Democratic PArty.

They don't hold the Senate, my friend, they have 48 seats and a tie breaker vote at best.

&gt;As with a candidate like Bernie. Who the DNC provably conspired against, along with the entire range of mainstream media. Democrats won't allow reform of the party.

Bernie wasn't eligible for the 2016 nomination, they were not going to give him the nomination after he left them without a candidate so he could run for Senate unopposed twice. 

They weren't going to let him do that to them during a presidential election.

That's why he had to sign a contract to run as a Democrat for 2020.

If he had accepted their nomination and run as a Democrat in his congressional races then it would have been a different story in 2016.

They *tried* to get him in office and welcome him into the party *twice* before he ran for president.

This idea that the DNC won't allow progressive politicians in is absurd.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.629, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 3.525, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.333, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.999, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.999, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.993,0.116,0.852,0.032,1

As opposed to what we have now?

I think what you're suggesting is mildly applicable in the wake of Dukakis' showing against Reagan, but neither before nor for long after.  Carter had already taken an anti-union stance, among other pro-corporate positions.  Clinton was more effective in pushing the anti-welfare state, pro-corporate wage cutting than his Republican predecessors.  By the time you get to Obama, the effect you describe was completely gone, and Democrats wanted socialized medicine and traditional Democratic policies.  We got a measure to put off the former, and nothing in therms of the latter.

How does appointing industry lobbyists to run the regulator agencies overseeing those industries, every bit as consistently as Republicans, serve to woo voters?  That's one of many examples where their conservative actions have been a detriment to, not an aid to winning votes.  Look at right now, and the popularity of countless measures that are falling by the wayside.  Is that also to win votes?  Or is it because they're put into office by precisely the same powers as those that put Republicans in power.  You notice that over the time from Carter to now, the major donors have increasingly shared by the two parties.

And lets not get started on the complete absorption of Democrats into the military-industrial complex, surveillance state.

Edit: I'd also add that without the Vietnam War, Johnson would have been one of the most popular presidents ever.  Because of the then controversial Civil Rights Act, but even more because of the not-at-all controversial Great Society policies.  Democrats broke with that tradition not because it wasn't getting votes, but because of corporate lobbying, and membership.  Carter lost not because he wasn't fiscally conservative enough, but because of the Arab Oil Embargo, and likely the illegal October Surprise negotiations by Republicans.","{0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.45, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.5895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.219, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.1395, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 4.65, 0, 0, 0, -2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.9, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0}",0.985,0.134,0.802,0.063,4

"Agreed. 

This article claims that if one single provision of the (probably) dozens of provisions for climate don't pass in the reconciliation package all voter turn out will stop for the midterms. 

But yesterday there was a CommonDreams post saying that if the Medicare expansion doesn't happen Democrats will lose the midterms.

I wonder if tomorrow there will be a post about Manchin that if he doesn't support Medicare For All by the end of these negotiations, that Democrats will also lose the midterms. 

Joking aside the climate stuff is a big deal but the objections Manchin has are with one provision in particular:

Manchin has at least always been who he is, and it's no surprise that he doesn't agree with the rest of the party when he never has.

He at least *has* an ideology, and good-faith negotiations might actually be possible with him if he were the only holdout. I won't pretend that his ideology isn't influenced by money, of course, but it's hardly a scandal that the senator from WV takes money from the most significant economic sector in WV.

Sinema, meanwhile, campaigned as a somewhat-progressive from a purple state that is only getting bluer, meaning she'd have a great shot at reelection if she just did what she promised. Her 180 makes no sense from any kind of coherent ideological perspective, nor even from a political perspective if she actually cared about getting reelected the way Mark Kelley appears to.

"I just cant understand peoples obsession with party.  In my home state of Oklahoma, the State Superintendent of Education (a Republican), switched to the Democratic Party so that she could run for Governor in 2022 (and most likely to quell a very popular progressive in the primary).  

So should voters automatically support her merely because shes a Democrat, as though she actually never changed platforms?  (Although, to be fair, theres not much difference between Democrats and Republicans on economic issues, so maybe it doesnt matter much.  We either get a corporate puppet with a red tie or a corporate puppet with a blue tie.)

Hell, since partisans are so concerned with voting for Democrats, I guess theyd have to throw their support for guys like Robert Byrd, Strom Thurmond, Theodore Bilbo, and Hugo Black if they were to run today because, well, they were lifelong Democrats.  I mean, if they really want to throw their weight behind a true Democrat, they couldnt do any worse than Andrew Jackson, who founded the party.

Now, I think that you and I both know how these partisans would respond.  But that was a different time back when the party stood for different values!

And theyre right, but they dont seem to realize that by invoking this defense, theyre making our whole argument for us!  Platform should **always** take precedence over party.  And if a party can change values over time, shouldnt the voters be willing to change and even abandon parties when necessary?  I mean, the Democratic Party used to represent progressive values just like they used to represent racist Southerners before then.

"&gt; we're lucky he didn't decide to take your advice and do nothing instead of picking up the pieces and passing the ACA

Are we?  Consider: we're back to the point where the healthcare system is in crisis.  A majority of Americans agree our healthcare system is not working. The ACA helped for a time, but it also defused the political will to enact meaningful change -- it basically kicked the can down the road to 2020.  

Furthermore, even protecting that watered-down kicking-the-can-down-the-road solution has required a massive amount of political capital. The Republicans still used the ACA to rally a base of intense opposition and controlled all 3 branches of government for years.  

We don't know what would have happened if Obama had truly fought for the necessary changes rather than accepting them being watered down.  We might have seen the real reform needed, or we might have seen the situation get bad enough that voters pushed *even Republicans* to support *real solutions.* 

This is the problem with What-Ifs.  

&gt; Biden faced a choice between passing part of his agenda 

Most of Biden's agenda is effectively dead at this point, not just the climate change portion.  Manchin and Sinema are primarily responsible for that -- by blocking removal of the fillibuster. 

[Biden's approval rating has been on a steady decline as a result.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/) Early evidence suggests the 2022 midterms will *not* be kind to the Democrats as a result. 

&gt; Manchin also has nothing left to lose by bucking his party

That's a potentially accurate point, sadly.  But the party also has a lot more to lose by him remaining a part of it than it stands to gain. 

Again: if Democrats fail on this issue, it will be a failure that hurts the entire party.  I think you really underestimate how many voters will refuse to show up for the Democrats if they can't pass meaningful climate policy.

"&gt; Solving climate change is a matter of survival.

Climate change isn't going to make the planet uninhabitable. The dirty truth is if you live in a rich country you're going to be shielded from most of the effects of climate change. A lot of people here think it's going to be the end of the world if we don't do anything, where mainstream climate scientists think that it will just be shitty.

For example look at studies that estimate the number of climate change deaths if we continue on the path we are on right now. 73 deaths per 100,000 people globally per year in 2100:

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/04/rising-global-temperatures-death-toll-infectious-diseases-study

Or 1.5-2 million deaths a year globally in 2100:

https://www.impactlab.org/news-insights/valuing-climate-change-mortality  
https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/04/04/document_gw_09.pdf

Which is fucking awful but isn't a ""collapse of society"" event. For comparison, 10 million people die a year from poverty right now.

Or look at how it will effect the economy. Not doing anything would [shave 10% off GDP,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/08/19/climate-change-could-cost-us-up-percent-its-gdp-by-study-finds/) but that would be 10% off [from growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(nominal\)#Long_term_GDP_estimates) that is a lot more then 10%. It would be awesome to have that extra 10% of GDP, but it's not the end of the world if we don't.

&gt;It is immediately apparent that economic costs will vary greatly depending on the extent to which global temperature increase (above preindustrial levels) is limited by technological and policy changes. At 2ﾰC of warming by 208099, Hsiang et al. (2017) project that the United States would suffer annual losses equivalent to about 0.5 percent of GDP in the years 208099 (the solid line in figure 1). By contrast, if the global temperature increase were as large as 4ﾰC, annual losses would be around 2.0 percent of GDP. Importantly, these effects become disproportionately larger as temperature rise increases: For the United States, rising mortality as well as changes in labor supply, energy demand, and agricultural production are all especially important factors in driving this nonlinearity.

&gt;Looking instead at per capita GDP impacts, Kahn et al. (2019) find that annual GDP per capita reductions (as opposed to economic costs more broadly) could be between 1.0 and 2.8 percent under IPCCs RCP 2.6, and under RCP 8.5 the range of losses could be between 6.7 and 14.3 percent. For context, in 2019 a 5 percent U.S. GDP loss would be roughly $1 trillion.

**Climate change doesn't have to make the planet entirely unliveable to cause mass suffering and disruption to normal lives.**

**Big edit:** 

Similarly, climate change doesn't have to *literally* make the entire planet uninhabitable to cause massive social impacts.  Extreme weather events triggered by climate change show a high potential to cause crop failures, and changes in growing zones and overall climate patterns will disrupt agriculture.  This can quickly have a destabilizing effect on social stability. [The Arab Spring was linked to spiking bread prices](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/17/bread-food-arab-spring).  Furthermore some areas such as India are [facing an emerging threat of deadly heatwaves](https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2021/09/09/heatwaves-have-emerged-as-a-deadly-health-hazard-in-india.html).  There are a few key factors to remember here:

* Extreme weather events and changing climate patterns will adversely effect agriculture -- food shortage triggers social instability locally and may cause mass migrations (edit: some degree of climate-related population migration is already a consensus view from climate researchers)
* Deadly heatwaves and food shortages or repeated extreme weather events will trigger large population migrations
* We already saw the social division with an influx of migrants from the Syrian Civil War -- I am a firm believer in open borders, but unfortunately there are always far-right groups that see this as a threat, and mass refugees trigger them to become more active and violent
* All of the above could easily lead to local wars -- and potentially larger conflicts as bigger nations align with specific factions
* Global trade is *heavily* interconnected -- the Pandemic has illustrated how fragile this is, and how much disruptions in one place cause ripple effects and shortages in seemingly unrelated areas -- these disruptions will only increase due to the above plus increased extreme weather.  
* Much of our current standard of living is based on global trade and global cooperation
* If there is sufficient disruption from the above factors, the overall globalized system will break down and we will see something different that is more localized and more nationalism as nations focus on their own interests when fighting for resources.  People will survive but it won't be the standard of living we know today.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.5, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, -1.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, -0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, -0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.9895, 0, -4.74555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, -3.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, -2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",-0.989,0.037,0.84,0.123,2

On top of that, it may be the case that the White House can convince Manchin on something close to the CEPP that may include a part about carbon capture so coal and natural gas can be considered ""clean"".  Not sure if that has been floated already but if it hasn't then it we could at least get some form of energy policy though it will include carbon capture which is controversial, then we should look out for that.

But the problem is overall decarbonisation velocity and how powergrid emissions interact with the rest of greenhouse emissions reductions.  To have a decent shot at 1.5C-2C we really do need to decarbonise the vast majority of the powergrid by 2030 (to achieve the 50% emissions reduction needed at that point).

Electricity generation [on its own does not account for the largest share of US emissions, per LLNL](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/charts/Carbon/Carbon_2019_United-States.png).  It's only 31.5%, and transportation is slightly more.  

To bring the rest of the emissions under control, we need to electrify transportation, industry, and building heating.  Electrification [will dramatically cut the amount of rejected energy, which accounts for roughly 2/3 of total primary energy use in the US](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/energy/us/Energy_US_2020.png) -- electric motors and heat pumps are vastly more energy-efficient than their fossil fuel competion.  Even when powered by dirty energy sources, this will cut emissions some.  Industrial process heat will likely be 1-for-1 in terms of efficiency (electric resistance heating etc aren't any more efficient compared to burning fuels).

But that electrification will substantially increase electricity consumption, and electrification initiatives are also slow (read: decades) and requires steep capital investments.  If the powergrid is vast-majority-green, then electrification delivers *substantially* higher emissions reductions. 

To add to this: it seems likely that policymakers are *underestimating* how easy it will be to mostly decarbonise the powergrid (based on exponential growth trends and plummeting costs for renewables and storage) -- but they are likely *also* under-estimating how hard it will be to address the more difficult structural emissions sources.  Land-use and agriculture emissions are particularly pernicious and difficult to address without major social changes.  Cement emissions aren't likely to go away any time soon. 

**It is critical that we front-load the fastest emissions reductions (powergrid) if we want to buy enough time to address the bigger challenges** -- and we need to assume that unexpected challenges will crop up along the way and it's already clear many nations will not be meeting their Paris goals.","{0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.65, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.067525, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.85, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, -1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.32323, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.3895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.6895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.64555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.502,0.099,0.824,0.077,3

If there was some magic words he could speak into the bully pulpit to make them fall in line we would have heard them by now. 

The only reason a bully pulpit, or internal pressure, would work is confidence that they have nowhere to go when pressured, that they want to stay as part of the party at the end of the day. but theoretically they can go into mcconnel's beckoning arms, The only reason we would say that's unlikely is loyalty to the party and I wouldn't really bank to hard on that loyalty with these two.

Theres no guarantee they will stay democrat if biden and Schumer start pushing hard, and if one of those two flip, everything is lost. The legislative agenda. Even the stuff we're currently getting, that is to say the court appointees, and the cabinet appointees..

We would even lose budget reconciliation, all it would take is one of them to flip and we lose our chance at passing budget through reconcilliation. Which means any budget would have to be greenlit by mcconnel,  just let that idea sink in. McConnell has gone on record he wants to obstruct.  It doesn't take much to  envision how much damage he can inflict. 

At least now we can theoretically get necessary stuff through reconciliation, that would be gone if Manchin or sinema decide they've had enough.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.777, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.1, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.75, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.99555, 0, 0, 3.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",-0.465,0.077,0.828,0.095,1

"The DNC sent 50 million unvaccinated kids back to school (""back to normal!"") to keep ""the economy"" healthy, anti-science, while enabling more drilling and ""nothing fundamentally changing for the rich"" (more anti-science).. Florida got a $15/hr minimum wage increase (when you can't afford a 2-bedroom anywhere in the country on less than $21/hr).. and a ""Democrat"" stopped it federally. Massive new military/Pentagon spending, mass evictions, abortion less legal than it was last year, Supreme Court unbalanced, billionaires becoming untaxed trillionaires (spellcheck doesn't even recognize ""trillionaires"".. but it will, oooh, it will! When you're that rich and ""politics"" is for purchase, no one can afford to ignore you..).

The current corporate DNC is all the ""GOP"" that ""Freedom""><U+0085>"" can endure, I think. And this is them in ""full control"", and ""post-Trump"", in the face of a very obvious and worsening capitalism/Exxon-fueled climate crisis.

We're supposed to be relocating people out of high-eco-stress/flood areas and conserving 35+% of all natural land permanently, and things like building carbon reclamation towers, recycling/waste management infrastructure, windmill farms and solar conversion for all homes, ""essential worker""/doctor/student protections (for this pandemic and the next, climate-crisis-driven), currently. Instead, Insurrectionist Trump is eating ice cream. Joe is eating ice cream. Pelosi is posing with thousands of dollars of ice cream.

A lot of people have been watching billionaire's rockets launches from their tents, lately (assuming their sometimes-""blue"", sometimes-""red"", city officials don't choose to destroy their tents, since one traumatic eviction apparently isn't enough).

The only thing the GQP isn't ""getting"" right now is a direct advancement of authoritarian fascism, but that's fine by them because *indirectly* nothing is fundamentally changing. Filibuster lives, ""fake news"" is just fine, voting is insecure, old ""fixers"" walk free while whistleblowers like Daniel Hale are swiftly punished..

Rittenhouse's judge (Trump appointed? Remember that? ""If she gets her judges in, folks.. nothing you can do.. unless..""? Some early projection!) said today that no one is allowed to refer to the people Rittenhouse murdered as ""victims"". ""Victims"" is not okay with the ""judge"", but ""arsonists"", ""looters"", and ""rioters"" is just fine.

Watching the DNC's ""response"" to the recent Pandora Papers and Facebook Papers/whistleblowers, as well. For now, most of them continue to support insurrection-fueling Facebook (many of the publications covering it are in lucrative article-sharing partnership with Facebook). We found out ATnT is OANN/terrorist-inflaming.. but did Joe (or anyone) return their ATT ""donations""?

What's left to wish for? They can take a 4 year vacation, enjoy the accountability-free looting they pulled off under Trump.. and wait.. what was it, ""stand back and stand by""? Worst thing is you can rub their ""Trump-era"" tweets in their faces, all the big (and vital) talk they never planned on delivering on (except.. it's absolutely necessary..).

I also think they're not really accounting for how many people Trump and Friend's braying woke up, politically.

"Please allow me to clarify.  If this country does, in fact, descend into fascism, which is a very real possibility, we should be looking at all the earmarks of what's really going on: 

1. [There have been claims of stolen elections before all votes have been counted or, in some cases, before elections have even taken place](https://archive.vn/vZlMe).
2. [Laws preventing minority groups from voting](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-october-2021)
3. [Laws have been passed that restrict the constitutional rights of anyone who isn't white, male, heterosexual, and Christian, while at the same time enhancing the rights of those in power who are](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Abortion-restrictions-transgender-issues-gun-15973501.php). (A side-effect of these laws will be that they will serve to distract from the voter restriction laws that would help prevent the unconstitutional stripping of rights of minorities.  [One look at the list of voting rights issues the ACLU is fighting in cases across the country](https://www.aclu.org/issues/voting-rights) tells us that they simply don't have enough time between now and midterm elections, or even the next presidential election, to litigate all these claims.)
4. [Some states have either passed or are discussing passing anti-protest bills that would limit/prohibit public protests in violation of our First Amendment rights](https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/rights-protesters/anti-protest-bills-around-country).  Some of these same states have [criminalized any effort for protestors to defend themselves against attacks from citizens, cops, or even motorists attempting to run them down in the street, and they've even gone so far as to absolve motorists of any criminality in running down protestors](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/republican-anti-protest-laws.html).

Of course, this is just a cursory overview of the tactics being employed by the right, as we've all seen from the wonderful posts by u/rusticgorilla.  The purpose of all this is a recipe for a consolidation of power, one that they perfected in the late--'70s/early-'80s, when Jerry Falwell and [Paul Weyrich, co-founder of the Heritage Foundation and originator of the term ""moral majority,""](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/magazine/trump-government-heritage-foundation-think-tank.html) worked to [coalesce Evangelicals and Catholics around the idea of being anti-abortion](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/).  They were able to form the religious right, and they swayed voters to their true cause, which was segregation.

Thus, time has grown short.  Even if Democrats were to win elections in vote-restricted, gerrymandered districts, what is the likelihood that those results would stand, since the new tactic has been to challenge any and all election results?  While it may not work to their favor in the short-term, in the long-run, the effect it will have is diminished voter turnout, b/c voters will grow apathetic.  They will think that their vote wouldn't make a difference, b/c it was simply going to be challenged every time, and even if the voting results weren't overturned, new laws restricting more and more voters' rights to vote would be passed.

When all of this is taken into account, Manchin and Sinema have a duty to uphold the Constitution for their constituents, and they're purposefully failing to do that.  If the tenuous balance we currently have falters b/c of the two of them, and more rights are stripped, violence is employed to keep people in line, and other fascist tactics are employed, the mob will come for them.  There's no doubt about that.  They think that they'll somehow be safe from that; that their money will save them.

Sure, they're looking to ensure voting rights, but that's as much about keeping them in office as it is about ensuring the constitutional rights of citizens.  What I don't see in their list is how to deal w/ the fascism and criminality that's become a staple of the force opposing them.

For a while, I couldn't understand what it was about the Democrats that made them unwilling to deal w/ this glaringly troublesome issue staring them right in the face.  They didn't talk about in those terms; they didn't deal w/ it in those terms; they didn't attempt to pass legislation that would inhibit the rise of this fervent fascination that the right had w/ fascism.  Day after day of examples would be trotted out by the right, and yet, the Dems would seemingly be oblivious to it all.

Then, when Manchin and Sinema pushed back on everything, the reason why dawned on me.  It was b/c, these so-called centrist Dems aren't really centrists at all.  They're really on the right in many of their values, so what the ""Republicans"" are doing isn't too far a stretch for what these Dems actually believe in.  For many of us, especially progressives, we view their actions as abhorrent and fascisistic, but to these Dems, they're just not seeing it that way.

There is no such thing as ""conservative"" fiscal policy in the United States; there never really has been in the contemporary era, and it drives me *insane* that the media continues to mindlessly parrot the word.  It is a meaningless descriptor used in place of describing Republicans actually are: the governmental apparatus for crony capitalism.

There has *never* been an actual consistent ideological standard for conservative economic policy other than ""tAx CuTs"" which itself is really nothing more than low-effort pandering to  ill-informed and uninformed voters.

Everything else they ""stand for"" is completely malleable.  When they are in power, they use the government to give massive handouts to the rich and the private sector, and you never hear a peep about ""fiscal conservatism"".  When Democrats are in power, Republicans are hair-on-fire crazy about the debt, deficits, bureaucracy, entitlements, etc. etc. 

The contrast between what conservatives want to spend money on vs. what liberals want to spend money on could not be clearer.  Liberals want to spend this money improving national infrastructure, guaranteeing access to decent health care for everyone, improving public education, and giving a base-level fuck about maintaining a climate that is suitable for HUMAN FUCKING LIFE.

If you are someone who just cannot figure out what is wrong with these right-wing crazies and their rhetoric filled with overt racism, gun worship, whacko conspiracy theories, and distorted Christianity... well, here it is:  the people in charge are using every bit of that to distract the peons from what they are really trying to do, which is juice this country and its people for every single dime they can to further insulate themselves from the rest of us.

The reason Trumpism is so damn scary to so many ""mainstream"" Republicans is that now, their voters have become so brainwashed by all the issues they've been using as distractions for decades, they're beginning to elect more and more leaders from among their own ranks rather than coronating rich folks who are already in on the whole grift. 

And therein lies the grandest irony of it all... before too long, the crazies will begin to pose an actual threat to the stability of the crony capitalist scheme.

Coal is, by comparison, incredibly cheap to acquire, transport, and convert to energy, which are the primary costs that would directly affect its use in the market.

"Sinema is trying to copy John McCain, without understanding in the *slightest* how John McCain cultivated his reputation and popularity.

For starters, he only *rarely* bucked the party, despite his reputation. He was quite a reliable vote. And almost always, his high-profile defections were either not the deciding vote (ie, purely symbolic) or clearly ""allowed"" by the party as a whole. (His last vote on the ACA? I'd bet money Mitch knew he'd vote against it, and was thrilled. The last thing the GOP wanted was to actually repeal the ACA at that point, as they'd be on point as tens of millions of Americans lost insurance).

And when he *did* buck the party, he had a way of tying it to his personal integrity or ideology or unpopular with his constituents, making it seem like a *principled* stand -- whether it was or not.

Sinema, on the other hand, has decided to rather randomly buck the Democrats on a high profile bill, one that's popular with her voters, and without any sort of reasoning that ties into her ideology -- in fact, she seems to be going *against* her own ideology as she's portrayed it in the past.

I'm fairly certain he's *trying* for ""Principled John McCain takes brave stance"" but is *getting* ""Sinema against bill for no reason she can articulate, so I guess pay-offs?""

Supposedly she's always had a hard time reading the room, and I don't know who she's listening to, but it's clearly not her constituents, the polls, or her fellow Democrats.

Banning abortion in all cases except rape, incest, and health of the mother would go a long way toward the Dems making inroads with red states

As for guns, mass shootings have been trending upward for decades while gun ownership has been flat or declining for decades

Granted, there is a link between domestic homicide rate and gun ownership according to the Journal of Preventative Medicine

[https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/777345](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/777345)

Why WVA folks cant figure out that NONE of their reps or senators CARE about them is beyond me! IF THESE PEOPLE CARED WOULD YOUR STATE BE THE SHAPE ITS IN? What he is doing makes no sense. He is fucking over 3/4s of the nations average citizens for WHAT REASON?

Mind you, congress just passed a defense pkg that spends $8 trillion over 10 yrs. The Infrastructure bills is LESS THAN HALF of that total over the same time frame. Makes NO Sense to spend EVER penny to defend a country whos infrastructure and its people are all crumbling before our eyes. Whats to defend going forward if EVERYTHING GOES TO SHIT? This country and its priorities are seriously FUCKED UP! The rest of the planet GOES FORWARD and the US STALLS IN PLACE  while buying enough weapons to annihilate the planet a thousand times over. STUPIDEST COUNTRY ON THE PLANET, with MANCHIN  &amp; SINEMA LEADING THE WAY.

THANKS SO MUCH MR &amp; MRS SELFISH!! Cuz its always about Krysten and Joe. 330 million Americans can just go get FUCKED thanks to them. Two Republican assholes on the TAKE if I ever saw any.

This is really what is driving inflation.  Yes, there are ""supply chain issues"".  Those are a direct result of the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy.  Tons of new money, chasing the same amount of production as before.  **The amount of money is existence has literally DOUBLED in one year.**

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm)

This has straight up broken the rules of fractional reserve banking.  With a 0% reserve ratio, the money multiplier is infinite.  Banks are effectively creating unlimited amounts of new money with there being no reserve requirement.  This is complicated, but you have to understand how the extension of credit creates new money.

Federal reserve lends money to bank A.  $100 of new money has been created.

Bank A takes that money, and lends it to someone else, who deposits it in a bank B.  Now note what happens here:  Bank A still treats that loan as an asset (worth $100).  Bank B also tracks that $100 as an asset.  From the Federal Reserve loaning $100, we now have $200.

Moreover bank B has a new $100 deposit, which they can lend on, up to $100.  (There is a 0% reserve ratio.)  Bank B makes a loan to person, and that person deposits it in Bank C.  Bank A, B, and C together now are tracking assets of $300, off a $100 loan from the Fed.

Since the reserve ratio is set to ZERO PERCENT, this can go on FOREVER.  The house of cards blows up when the economy turns, and the chain of defaults comes crashing down.

We've never had a **zero percent reserve ratio before.**  It's absurd.  For this exact reason.

If the reserve ratio is any positive number, the amount of lendable money would decrease with each new extension of credit.  When it's zero, the same dollar can be extended as credit... forever.  Every time you extend credit, you create new money.  Monetary policy is weird.

...

The Federal Reserve **might have been captured by special interests.**  It can't be ruled out.  They're acting insane.

"&gt;It says a lot that you're focusing on headline inflation rather than [specifics.](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm). Specifics which clearly point towards covid-related supply chain shocks rather than a weakening of the value of our currency. 

I'm not, because I haven't said anything about current inflation at all. 

You're the only one who keeps bringing it up. 

You said that West Virginians would benefit from ""a good round of inflation."" I responded that inflation hurts everyone.

That has nothing to do with whether current inflation is transitory or related to a weakening dollar. 

&gt;Any, literally any, introductory session of economics courses will explain how inflation has an erosive effect on the principal value of outstanding debt obligations, 

Debt holders get fucked by inflation. I know. 

You said that inflation causes a shift from asset holders to the poor. 

Those are two different statements.

&gt;Inflation coming above expectations, without verging into the uncontrolled territory of the Carter-era stagflation, is by definition a benefit to anyone on a fixed-rate mortgage, for example. 

Yes. 

The question is whether that benefit on their mortgage outweighs the catastrophe of having their income slashed year over year. 

The poor are the ones least likely to be able to negotiate wage hikes to offset inflation.

I have the leverage to demand a cost of living increase every year - a Walmart cashier does not. What has happened to the minimum wage is proof enough of that. 

&gt;People's wages and salaries are going to adjust faster than the debt obligation of their student loans or their mortgages. 

By definition. And a turtle moves faster than a rock. 

The problem isn't whether they see some hypothetical net benefit after a 30-year cycle, but whether they can keep up their lifestyle in the meantime. 

Telling somebody that they will have saved a net 6% on their mortgage by retirement isn't helpful when they have to stop going to restaurants and can't afford car repairs and new refrigerators in the short term. 

Further, and again, you specifically mentioned a transfer from asset holders to the poor. 

The poor don't even have mortgages to play this hypothetical game.

"We're not experiencing 5-10% annual inflation. We're experiencing COVID-19 supply shortages. 

Take cars for instance - The auto manufacturers cancelled their chip orders because they thought they wouldn't be selling any cars during the pandemic and were lowering production.

The chip fabs pivoted to other products as people were working from home and ordering an insane amount of laptops. 

Car sales started to pick up - Now there are no chips for the automakers. GM and Ford (and others I assume) are now doing massive production cuts and can't keep up with demand. 

Therefore... new cars are hard to find and expensive. That also drives up the cost of used cars. Another knock-on effect is that the rental car companies, that sold off their fleets at the beginning of the pandemic, can't get any new cars to restock their fleets - so rental cars are extremely expensive. Also because the rental car companies are desperate for cars the cars they would usually sell into the used market, they aren't selling, further driving up the cost of used cars.

Theyre straight up reckless.  For some idea of the scale:  the monetary base (deposits plus cash in circulation) has DOUBLED in a single year.

This is what is leading to the skyrocketing inflation.  Inflation has historically screwed over wage earners, while benefiting those that hold all the non-cash assets.

They reduced they reserve ratio to zero percent.  Unheard of.  It means there is no limit to the money multiplier effect of fractional reserve banking.  Ive linked to the charts in numerous previous posts, trying to raise awareness.

Wage earners are seeing real incomes drop at a precipitous rate.

I think this is useless in a void. The deficit under Obama dropped as the economy returned. That's a natural reponse. More tax revenue from increased good flow is a normal feature. Meanwhile, the economy itself was cooling down. This is also why Obama administrative last year saw an inceased deficit, because the economy wasn't booming anymore and spending by the government was slowly replacing it. Trump term simply followed the curve. Spending to stave off the recession. Sorta worked till covid blow a hole in the tire.

All other policies aside, and there a lot under that hood that we didn't discuss, this is a natural feature.

Depends on the conditions of victory.  Deficit spending isn't bad on its own.

&gt;Needs based with means testing guardrails/formulas on new spending  
&gt;  
&gt;Targeted spending caps on existing programs

Again, I can't see progressives agreeing on this. It's just a way to exclude often the most needy Americans from the very funds that are supposed to help them. This is 90's Newt Gingrich-era stuff.

&gt;  
&gt;Vehicle and fuel tax credits shall not be limited to electric vehicles -- they must include hydrogen.

Manchin buys into the fossil fuel industry's position of ""yeah, we need to move on from fossil fuels, but we can't do it that fast!"" They never explain *why* they can't do it that fast -- the only thing stopping us is policy proposals like these, which insist on giving incentives for the very thing we're supposed to be sunsetting! Climate change might be *the* most important issue of our lifetime, and Manchin is punting hard. Not surprising for someone with constituents who love coal, but it would be better if he asked for funding to open up new industries in West Virginia to replace the inevitable end of the fossil fuel industry. It's clear his priority is moneyed interests before the obvious good.

Yet again, another dealbreaker for progressives, and anyone who talks to a scientist.

&gt;Any revenue exceeding $1.5T shall be used for defect reduction

90's era Gingrich again. Manchin is essentially a Republican circa 30 years ago. He doesn't want to spend 3.5T, but he still wants to collect the money as if we were. Absurd. The moment the GOP are back in power, they'll use that reduction in deficit as yet another excuse to give tax breaks to the rich. Which makes the following all but temporary:

&gt;Corporate tax rate: 25%  
&gt;  
&gt;Corporate domestic minimum tax: 15%  
&gt;  
&gt;Raise the top rate on ordinary income: 39.6%  
&gt;  
&gt;Raise cap gains rate: 28% All in  
&gt;  
&gt;End carried interest

This is the only stuff that seems to satisfy a Democratic priority, albeit half-heartedly. The rest is hot garbage.

Maybe Manchin is just putting up this proposal, hoping to get *some* changes to the reconciliation bill so he can go home and campaign on those changes, apart from the larger bill that may be used against him. But asking for *all* of this, and no more, is essentially asking the Democratic caucus to do nothing.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, -1.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.518, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, -0.8465, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0.55, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0.333, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.6395, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, -1.221, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.333, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.997,0.163,0.794,0.042,5

Totally misleading. The problem isn't hydrogen production, but distribution.

Literally the opposite of reality. Since it takes up much more volume than gasoline, you can't transport it on trucks like you can with gasoline. Pipelines  wouldn't work either as hydrogen is nature's best escape artist. And local production at every gas station is cost prohibitive.

* Time based restrictions on funding dispersals have the same issues and consequences; both of these first two are long-proven examples of ""common sense"" creating inefficiency out of a desire to hand-wring
* Demands on the federal reserve are the most shocking thing here, as mentioned elsewhere.  This is a BIG no-no.  There are few things more dangerous to the global economy than politicians trying to impose command economy mandates on the reserve.
* The LifeBOAT Act is fine
* I'm going to give the WV guy a longer leash on climate policy, though basically all of this is directly against the global consensus by climate scientists and economists
* Sole ENR control of climate policy means that he wants the committee he chairs to have total control over national climate policy, which is bigger than the specifics here and more egregious
* The excess revenue going to the deficit seems to mostly want to take advantage of delaying payments and isn't the best solution
* The tax changes are mostly in line with the Democratic proposal; honestly I disagree with the American philosophy of taxes as social policy so I won't comment too much on this.

* $2T in spending
* Direct mandates to the Federal Reserve
* The entirety of the US's federal climate policy

I definitely wouldn't be so bold as to say this *never* happens, but it seems like it generally wouldn't. When a senator leaves office they generally don't have any leverage over company X. The company could just not hire them, and the senator isn't going to announce some illegal verbal contract.

Or the senator has leverage/ability in the form of relevant expertise/connections outside of passing bills in the Senate, in which case it's highly likely the senator already has ideological commitments in favour of company X anyway. Or could get a job on their own merits

Unless I'm missing something, *in general*, this doesn't seem like it would be a major strategy contrasted with the usual theory of companies simply trying to elect people who already agree with them or companies trying to explain industry topics (in a light most favourable to the company of course).

2. My understanding is the progressives holding up the bipartisan bill are doing so because the moderates are holding up the reconciliation bill. Reconciliation is a messy process that is still in itself getting more known. I believe the parliamentarian made an update [\(link\)](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/politics/senate-parliamentarian-immigration-budget-economy/index.html).

"So i guess this is why i framed in such a way in regards to manchins argument. I think we cant dismiss his argument on ""fiscal responsibility"" because i think that is a political ideaology that is at least prevalent enough in the US to cause concern if dems dont at least acknowledge it. I dont see the spending as an issue although the revenue portion i am a bit skeptical of still. But it is a concern some voters have that i think is at least valid. We probably should educated people better on government in general but i will also say some people have concerns i think are at least rooted in some legitimacy. I cant recall if it was warren or Sanders but in the dem primary when pushed on Medicare for all and how to pay for it i recall the answer wasnt... clear. I think we should spend to help our populace but we should at least be smart about it as best we can.

Example: The pandemic relief bills are necessary spending and shouldnt be scrutinized for raising the debt because these are life saving bills based on a unique problem.

Infrastructure while important is something that will always be an issue and probably deserves a proper funding source in order to cover.

on why progressives are holding up the bipartisan bill, I think it makes perfect sense. Centrist democrats, especially Joe Manchin, care a lot about the bipartisan deal. It shows that people can still work together in Washington. As such, holding the bipartisan bill hostage is how they can ensure that centrists support the reconciliation bill. Reconciliation is still very much a work in progress, which is why progressives are trying to sink this vote on the bipartisan deal.
  
 
There's really no downside. The worst case scenario is that this stalemate lasts several more months and centrists absolutely refuse to support reconciliation, and then they can just pass the bipartisan bill anyway. That seems quite unlikely though.

If you honestly think that average american voters care about the timings of votes on a bill that eventually passes anyway, I don't even know what to say. This is flying hilariously under the radar compared to anything that americans actually give a shit about. There is a 0% chance this affects the elections.   
 
  
&gt;the same people advocating 'force the vote' on M4A are running the same strategy again.  
  
 
Force the vote would've been a fine idea if M4A had any chance at a majority in either house. Reconciliation has a very good shot at majorities in both houses, and holding the bipartisan bill hostage will likely help with that.  
 
  
&gt;It's what mercifully lost Trump the House in 2018, and Dems cannot afford to lose anything right now.

 
 
 Republicans lost the House because they went after people's healthcare which lost them voters and really activated Democratic voters. 41% of exit poll voters said that healthcare was the most important issue. Democrats won those voters 75-23.  I do not think Republicans lost the House because they poorly timed a vote on a bill that eventually passed anyway.

"I agree that the reconciliation bill will get passed eventually and almost surely lower then the current 3.5 trillion.

I guess i have a problem with the logic of holding it up still. Yes it is def a tactic since to your point it is important to moderates. But i wonder what the damage could be in 2022 and 2024. If i am a dem in an at risk district up in 2022 i think i would be pissed playing games with a safe district dem to get a bill that will get passed but should have more discussion due to its size and also complexity. What is a better messaging for running on reelection, we passed a bill and now our local x is going to get funding or hey vote for me to stay in power so we can pass legislature during my next term. Now that may be giving voters to much credit on why they vote but i think results would help those dems. So i worry we are playing games on a [popular american](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/569343-majorities-back-biden-spending-plan-infrastructure-bill-poll) policy to get both through now instead of playing it slower on the more complicated policy. Dems have a thin majority im not keen on losing especially when we saw how it unfolded under obama.

Now to be fair i did just show you that data says a majority of americans seem to support both bills so i will say im not happy with Manchin and Sinema holding up the other bill either but i think they still have alot of questions on what should be in that bill. I wrote in a different thread i would really prefer some of the fluff for that bill be removed even if i like the policy. I really want some green energy spending, more child policy (which i think would provide a massive boost to biden/dem imagery), and more infrastructure money. Immigration is an issue but i think i would prefer that would be worked on in a seperate bill and also stuff like the college education stuff not be included. 

We went through this same charade with Manchin once so i am still holding out hope Biden has some tricks up his sleeve because i think not passing either bill gives republicans a boost electorally imo.

People who accept the axioms necessary for liberalism, about individualistic morality and the primacy of personal freedom above all else, aren't examining an idea and then accepting it. Usually they've already accepted it, without the examination. That's not a cult, that's just a status quo. Ironically its pretty collectivist. 

&gt; Never has a liberal said anything worth considering in regards to politics, because they default to protecting the system at all costs. They are an irrational hivemind of credit ghouls.

"Yes, we believe that people should be responsible for their actions. However, we acknowledge that the decision to act a certain way can be influenced by varying factors like the system or society. This is also the reason why we talk about incentives in a system, especially if we criticize  policies. You have to look at the whole decision-making process and not just at the action and the outcome. And here you can clearly see that this so-called contradiction doesn't exist since the systemic influence on one's decision is represented in this process. 

In your example, this would mean that yes, Joe Manchin is responsible for his actions but the system in itself creates contradicting incentives that influences his decisions. Interestingly enough, institutions that were influenced by classical liberalism still take this into account. For example, a court analyses the factors that influenced the decision to act in a criminal way. I find it interesting that you call us irrational and unnuanced while also creating a premise that likely doesn't exist just to create an ad hominem argument. Aren't logical fallacies irrational?

Edit: I have some things to add to my comment. In another comment, OP says that socialist look at the decision-making process and incentives and then says that capitalists are incapable of this which is interesting since the whole capitalist analysis of the overall economy is based on the analysis of incentives. The best examples are the Lucas critique or the Cobra effect. Thinking in incentives is one of the most important things in economics and is also quite often used to criticize policies by liberal parties. Furthermore, there are also socialists that are incapable of thinking in this way because this kind of thought process has nothing to do with socialism or capitalism.

"&gt; The politician's sworn duty is to the public. They literally take an oath. Not every politician is corrupt, so it's not a systemic problem. Corruption is definitely an individual choice. 

If your system relies on individuals having a certain virtue, and they often do not have that virtue, then the problem is systemic. You can blame the individuals if you'd like, but at a certain point it's stupid to keep trusting them.

So if you want to call individual politicians bad and untrustworthy people for taking bribes, fine. But if you continue to stake the health of your democracy on them *not* taking bribes, and then many of them take bribes just like in the past, then that is a bad system. And scolding the individuals within it won't make the system work any better.

At a certain point, you need to decide whether you care more about adjudicating the virtues of individuals, or building a functional society. I care about the second one.

Yeah that's why slaveowners had tiny houses and no political power. Cause slavery isn't profitable.

&gt; You have always been free to live in your system with likeminded socialists. Your system can't involve forcing others to live in your system.

I can't believe that you're being genuine when you say this. Both of our systems require the infrastructure and resources that we both rely on now. In a socialist system, you would not strike out on your own and build from the ground up a liberal economy. You would want continued access to the society you live in, and a say in how that society is structured. So do we.

And any system invovles some amount of force. It's just naive to think otherwise. Any system, capitalism and socialism included, involve forcing people to behaving in a certain way. Liberalism is the system which you believe forces people to do the right thing (i.e., you think it's right to force me to respect private property), but that is force. And as natural as you think it is to force me to respect private property, I think it's just as natural and obvious to violate private property and forcible ensure that people's needs are met.

But the motivation behind the bribe doesn't go away, and nor do the resources with which to bribe. Essentially, shrinking the government doesn't shrink the power, becuase the government was never the power in the first place.

Also I don't understand the faith that so many people place in the constitution. It's currently being trampled on, so I don't get why you think it can serve as protection.

The US has very-well distributed property power, with 32.5 million businesses and 18 million millionaires. Real-world socialism destroys that distribution and pools all that power into the gov't.

&gt; Not trampling it is the protection. 

I'm sorry I don't see how you think that works.

I think you're saying that the constitution is a protection against the state trampling your rights. But there the constitution is, proudly displayed, and the state is trampling it and your rights. So clearly the constitution does not protect you. If the state abode by the constitution it wouldn't be trampling your rights, sure. But, it's not abiding by the constitution. How would you make the state abide by the constitution? You can't just invoke the constitution like a spell, you need some material power here, which it is clear the constitution does not provide.


&gt; You may have never read it. It is a power-limiting document.

Ok, well I think you'll find that writing something down in a document doesn't make it so. If you'd like proof of this, may I direct your attention to a document called ""The Constitution,"" which forbids many of the things that our government is currently doing.

The constitution *would* protect your rights, if the state obeyed it. And the constitution *would* limit power, if the state obeyed it. Why would the state obey it?

Centrists and top House Democrats have favored focusing resources on a smaller number of programs for the long term.

When debating how to focus our efforts under financial constraints, moderates have it right and progressives have it wrong. Its better to do a few things and do them really well and fund them for a long time so they can make a noticeable difference in peoples lives.

"Go look up Modern Monetary Theory, and you'll see that komrade GaryB was consistently arguing its ideas.  MMT is old-style monetary theory infused with a bunch of nonsensical Marxist claptrap.  

For example, one of the things he would often say was that it's impossible for the US to default or go bankrupt as long as it has the ability to print money, so deficit spending isn't a problem.  

Technically, it's true that a country that prints fiat money can't default.   \*But\*, to conclude that deficit spending isn't a problem, based on that, is sheer idiocy.  Drooling, brain-damaged lunacy.  

With too much debt, a country eventually has to print more money to pay off its creditors.  Creditors don't like that, because printing money is inflationary, and their risk increases dramatically, to the point where a positive return becomes questionable.  They stop investing, and the country then needs to print even more money to make their debt go away via inflation/devaluation of the currency.

Unfortunately, making their debt go away in this fashion also makes the savings and accumulated wealth of the country's citizens go away, too.  So, no, the US won't technically default/go bankrupt.  It'll just crash the world economy and leave all of its citizens penniless.

Oddly, that scenario is entirely consistent with Marxist revolution.

1.  **The Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Bill** which includes hard infrastructure, a new budget amount for the current infrastructure spending, expansion of broadband, etc.  - It has passed the Senate ALREADY (in a BI\_Partisan manner) and is being held hostage in the House because the Progressives there refuse to vote on it before the Social Spending RECONCILIATION Bill.  If the BI-Partisan Infrastructure Bill passes the House, with no changes, it goes directly to the President for his signature.
2.  **The Social Spending BBB RECONCILIATION Bill** is called ""reconciliation"" because it is a spending bill and is  going to be presented to the Senate, once it is written and passed in the House, under the Reconciliation process of bill passing - meaning in order to avoid the Filibuster debate rule they will pass it in the Senate with just (50) \[Democrat\] votes - that's why the votes by Manchin and Simena are so important because they are part of that (50) votes - they are both Democrats.

The Reconciliation Bill (Social Spending) has been changed so much at this point, it will have to be completely re-written, re-evaluated as to its finance structure.  Programs have been removed, shortened and morphed in many other ways.

We will just have to wait and see what the Speaker brings to the House floor today and how the Democratic members of the House vote - the Dems under the current House makeup only have (3) votes they can lose -","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.093, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.7, 0}",-0.765,0.007,0.955,0.038,0
